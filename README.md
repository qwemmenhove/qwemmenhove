- 👋 Hi, I’m @qwemmenhove (you can call me Q)
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS, cybersecurity (reading Sandworm), and geopolitical issues that shape our daily lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to deploy cloud architecture using AWS CDK
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an alternative way to do things. If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. So I appreciate being able to broaden my toolkit and be able to look at the problem from a different angle.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send me a message here.
